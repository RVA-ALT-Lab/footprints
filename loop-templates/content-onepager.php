				<p>
					<span class="drop-cap">T</span>his expedition class explores the intersection of human and natural history in the James River and its watershed. By immersing themselves in this environment, students will experience this intersection firsthand, learning the landscape that shaped the development of many cultures, including our city, state and nation.
				</p>
				<p>
					The James River is a feature of profound natural and historic interest in the history of our nation. In many ways the history of human settlement in the James River watershed mirrors the history of the United States. &#x1F463;

					The 2019 Footprints on the James Expedition will travel for 19 days, covering 185 river miles. The journey begins at the Falls of the James in downtown Richmond and proceeds by kayak downriver through the Tidewater to the colonial capital at Jamestown Island. The class then travels to the foothills of the Blue Ridge mountains &#x1F304; and returns to the river at Lynchburg. From Percival’s Island in downtown Lynchburg, the class travels through the Piedmont by canoe and batteau, retracing the historic trade routes of the late eighteenth century for the remainder of the class, finishing our journey near the dams above Richmond.

					This year’s expedition will offer students two classes, BIOL391 The Natural History of the James River Watershed and ENVS491 Expedition Management, for a total of 6 credits. These courses will be taught in tandem and have been specifically developed to reflect the immersive nature of the experience.
				</p>
				<p>	
					Learning natural history in an expedition format offers several unique and important opportunities to our participants. BIOL391 emphasizes observation and application of quantitative and qualitative field skills where students are encouraged to work as team members, and will be instructed in expedition management, group dynamics, and leadership skills &#x1F4E3;. They will learn best practices for frontcountry and backcountry camping, outdoor living skills, multi-day canoeing and kayaking methods and practical application of <a href="https://lnt.org/learn/7-principles">Leave No Trace principles</a> &#x1F3D5;. These will be assessed periodically by the review of reflection and observation journal entries and cumulatively by a final practical exam.

				<h2>Trip Life</h2>
				<p>
					<span class="drop-cap">A</span>ll participants will be living, travelling, and learning in variety of camping locations in close proximity to the James River and its watershed. From the first night out &#x1F30C;, everyone will be living out of a backpacking tent and eating meals prepared by our classmates. After the first week, most of your nights will be spent in a different place from the evening before. While there will be a few opportunities for a night back in Richmond, we will spend 19 days and nights in the field.

					Showers, grid electricity and refrigeration will be infrequent if not absent. The class will take place during the early summer in Virginia; students will have ample opportunity to consider mosquitos, heat, sunburn, ticks, chafing, and body odor &#x1F9DF;. To accommodate this, the day to day operations of this trip will be largely the responsibility of the student participants. This will require both self discipline and cooperation among our members.

					Living arrangements are established enough to maintain a smooth flow of work and life without being burdensome. To this end, students share group responsibilities by rotation. These responsibilities include traditional expedition participating in educational opportunities, writing daily journal entries &#x270F;. Student Trip Leaders will be responsible for making sure that everything that needs to happen does happen each day. Trip Leaders will make all final decisions, delegate authority, and define duties for the others when necessary.

				<h2 id="homepage-goals">Course Goals</h2>
				<p>
					Students should be able to:
					<ul>
						<li>identify the major features of a river system and its related watershed</li>
						<li>discuss the distinguishing features of the James River and its watershed</li>
						<li>identify, compare and discuss features of a biological system of interest in each of the regions of the river (or equivalent independent project)</li>
						<li>recognize and understand many of the ways in which human habitation and development have impacted the James River, and vice versa</li>
						<li>understand & explain connections between the river and the land which surrounds it</li>
						<li>learn, use, and demonstrate proficiency in expedition skills, management, and logistics as it relates to this experience</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<div class="wave-break">
				</div>
				<h2>Expectations</h2>
				<p>
					<h3>Expedition Mindset:</h3> Each student should undertake this experience with an open mind and a clear sense of purpose. This includes developing an expedition mindset to maximize the opportunity. It will be up to each of us to do our part to generate and maintain an environment conducive to safety and learning. We must each do our part to treat our classmates as we wish to be treated.
				</p>
				<p>
					<h3>Writing:</h3> We will be writing and sketching much of our course material by hand in bound journals.
				</p>
				<p>
					We will be living and learning in a field setting with minimal access to the outside world, which includes access to cell phone signal, the internet, and other people.
				</p>
				<!-- <p>
					<h3>Honor Code:</h3> Giving or receiving unauthorized assistance on tests or any other graded activities, as well as plagiarism, are violations of the University's Honor Code and will result in failure and a referral to the Student Honor Court. Also, students who observe cheating or any violation of the Honor Code have a responsibility to follow the procedures detailed in the Virginia Commonwealth University Student Handbook.
				</p> -->
				<!-- <p>
					Participants will be held to the <a href="https://conduct.students.vcu.edu/student-code-of-conduct/">VCU Student Code of Conduct</a> at all times. This document and other relevant information can be found at the following link. Please pay particular attention to the section regarding conduct off-campus.
				</p> -->
				<p>
					<h3>Required Readings:</h3> TBD. Students will be given a course pack with required readings, articles, etc.
				</p>
				<div class="wave-break">
				</div>
				<h2>Assessment</h2>
				<p>
					<!-- <h3>Grades for all assignments will be on this scale:
						<h4>
							90-100%=A, 80-89%=B, 70-79%=C, 60-69%=D, 0-59%=F
						</h4>
					</h3> -->
				</p>
				<p>
					This class will be assessed by a variety of traditional assessment techniques, including grading writing assignments, a written examination, and topical presentations. In addition, we plan to have students to undertake individualized and specialized research, and then teach some content of their own. Each student will be expected to keep journals of their observations and experiences during these exercises. Students will also be expected to keep a detailed and analytical personal journal of the class, to serve as an assessment tool as well as an outlet of student creative expression and self reflection.
				</p>
				<p>
					<h3>Field and personal reflection journal:
						<!-- <h4>
							20% field, 20% reflection
						</h4> -->
					</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>1st entry before departure – discuss any expectations and fears you have about this trip/course, etc.</li>
						<li>Daily reflection – open ended and/or specific questions</li>
						<li>Field notes – species seen, behavior, ecology, habitats, drawings, etc.</li>
						<li>Pencil and Pen, Rite in the Rain notebook or paper recommended</li>
					</ul>
				<p>
					<h4>Field Journal:</h4> There will be two types of journal entries for this course. The first will be a natural history observation journal. We will expect daily entries, based on the methods and suggestions outlined in the Farnsworth et al. 2014 paper from the Journal of Natural History Education and Experience.
				</p>
				<p>
					<h4>Reflection Journal:</h4> Students are required to complete a minimum of 12 personal journal entries during the trip. Entries should be 1-2 full pages (front and back) in length. Students should write an entry every 2 days, and entries should analytically connect students’ experiences at the sites, their interactions with speakers/activists, course readings, and the experience of traveling. Your journal entries should be written every day or at least every couple of days.
				</p>
				<p>
					In other words, we don’t want you to go a week without writing anything and then write daily during the last week of the course. It is important for your reflection and analysis to spread out the journal entries across the four weeks. Other than these guidelines, there are no assigned topics for these journal entries. Journals will be collected and checked periodically on the trip. You will turn in your journal at the end of the trip.
				</p>
				<p>
					<h3>Participation and Professionalism:
						<!-- <h4>
							30%
						</h4> -->
					</h3>
				</p>
				<p>
					Are you engaged in discussions, have you prepared for lectures and discussions by reading the assigned papers, are you excited to learn new skills, are you willing to help out the rest of the field team by stepping in and lending a hand when needed?
				</p>
				<p>
					Is your general conduct with faculty, student leaders and invited speakers professional? This includes both field and “off-hours” for the duration of the course (See the Professionalism Grading Rubric below).
				</p>
				<p>
					<h3>Practical Exam:
						<!-- <h4>
							15%
						</h4> -->
					</h3>
				</p>
				<p>
					This exam will be an assessment of your comprehension and retention of the material and techniques present up to the end the week at the Rice Center.
				</p>
				<!-- <p>
					<h3>End of Course Project/Presentation:
						<h4>
							15%?
						</h4>
					</h3>
				</p>
				<p>
					This will consist of a final presentation on the final day of class, 6/18. These presentations will be synthetic evaluations of observations made in the field. The topics should relate to course subject material. Topics will be evaluated and approved before we leave the Rice Rivers Center. These will be done in groups of 2.
